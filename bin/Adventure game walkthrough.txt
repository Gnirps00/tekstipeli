* Shortly explained, in this game, you have to collect three gems, set them to the area ‘basement’ and wake up Merlin. Read the hint and get the key for final room, where is final problem. Solve the problem and go to teleport room, and you’ve passed the game!
* The game starts from bedroom. (On the map it’s simply ‘Start’)
* Get the dictionary from the room. To read this dictionary, you have to use a command examine.
* Go East and read the text.
* Go East and collect blue gem.
* Go West and go South. Collect green gem.
* Go West and read the text. It’s written in Japanese, so use command examine dictionary, and translate it to english. (If you can read Japanese, then you don’t need it XD)
* Go South and collect red gem. If player didn’t know how to translate, steward gives a hint for that.
* Go North, East and then down. There is sleeping Merlin. Set every collected gems and wake up Merlin. Merlin teaches how to open the way to flower garden.

* Go East and collect key.
* Go West and three times North.
* At North Corridor use the key you’ve collected from the flower garden. Door opens.

* Go North and you’ve cleared the game!


Secret trick!
* As you can see from the map (because you are a course assistant), there is a secret room in North of bedroom.
* Use abrakadabra north in bedroom and open the way to there. 
* Go North. And you’ll realize that there is a way to East.
* Go East. And you are in the final room without using the Key!!
* And just solve the problem as normal way and you’ve cleared the game!!

About the map:
* There are two different maps in this file. One is for normal player and one for you assistants. Please use the second one, because there are all the items and secret room drawn, so it's easier to clear the game.
